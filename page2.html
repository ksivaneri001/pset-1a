			<h2>What is Addition? How do you do it?</h2>
			
			<p>Addition is when you take two or more numbers and put them together to create a larger number. It is represented by a <strong>+</strong> sign. The numbers being added are called <strong>addends</strong>, </p>
			<p>Here's an example. Let's say you have 3 apples. If someone gives you 2 more, then you have to add 2 apples. You this by counting 2 numbers beyond 3. One number after 3 is 4, and two numbers after 3 is 5. Therefore, <strong>3 + 2 = 5</strong>.</p>
