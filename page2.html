			<h2>What is Addition? How do you do it?</h2>
			
			<p>Addition is when you take two or more numbers and put them together to create a larger number. It is represented by a <strong>+</strong> sign. The numbers being added are called <strong>addends</strong>. The answer is called the <strong>sum</strong>.</p>
			<p>Here's an example. Let's say you have 3 apples. If someone gives you 2 more, then you have to add 2 apples. You this by counting 2 numbers beyond 3. One number after 3 is 4, and two numbers after 3 is 5. Therefore, <strong>3 + 2 = 5</strong>.</p>

			<h3>Practice Problems:</h3>
			<p>2 + 5 = <strong>?</strong></p>
			<p>3 + 7 = <strong>?</strong></p>
			<p>8 + 6 = <strong>?</strong></p>
			<p>9 + 2 = <strong>?</strong></p>
			<p>1 + 4 = <strong>?</strong></p>
			
			<h3>Answers:</h3>
			<p>2 + 5 = <strong>7</strong></p>
			<p>3 + 7 = <strong>10</strong></p>
			<p>8 + 6 = <strong>14</strong></p>
			<p>9 + 2 = <strong>11</strong></p>
			<p>1 + 4 = <strong>5</strong></p>
			
			<h2>Adding with Two or More Digits (Carrying the 1)</h2>
			
			<p>When you add numbers with two or more digits, you want to follow the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Line one number on top of the other, making sure that the last digits of each number are lined up in a column.</li>
				<li>Start adding the numbers in each column and writing the sum below.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If the numbers add up to a number that is 10 or greater, write the second digit of that sum below. Then, in the next column to the left, add a 1 on top. This is called "Carrying the 1."</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Move on to the next column to the left and do the same.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If you carried the one previously, be share to add that 1 in addition to the numbers in the column.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Repeat this process until you have done it for all the columns.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Note that for the last column, you don't need to carry the one. Write the sum as it is.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>The sum will be the number at the bottom</li>
			</ol>
