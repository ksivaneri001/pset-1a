			<h2>What is division? How do you do it?</h2>
			<p>Division is when you take an amount and distribute evenly across a certain number of things. It is represented by a <strong>÷</strong> or a <strong>/</strong> symbol. This can be like splitting a number of pizza slices to a certain number of people so everyone gets the same amount.</p>
			<p>The initial amount is called the <strong>dividend</strong>, the number it is being divided by is the <strong>divisor</strong>, and the answer is the <strong>quotient</strong>.</p>
			<p>Here's an example to help visualize division. If you have 8 marbles, and you want to distribute it evenly across 2 people, how many would each person get. You can find this by finding how many groups of 2 fit into 8, or <strong>2 * <em>?</em> = 8</strong>.
			The answer would be 4. Therefore, <strong>8 / 2 = 4</strong>.</p>

			<h2>Division with Remainders</h2>
			<p>Often, numbers aren't going to divide perfectly. For instance, when dividing 8 by 3, there is not an exact number of groups of 3 that fit into 8. This is where remainders come in.
			A <strong>remainder</strong> is the amount left over after dividing. It is represented by writing the letter <strong>R</strong> after the quotient, followed by the remainder itself.</p>
			<p>For instance, when dividing 8 by 3, 3 fits into 8 a total of 2 times. If you tried to add a third 3, then you would get 9, which is over 8. Since it only fits into 8 a total of 2 times, do 3 * 2 = 6.
			Now, take the dividend and subtract it by the product. In this case, that would be subtracting 8 by 2. 8 - 6 = 2, so the remainder is <strong>2</strong> Your final is <strong>8 / 3 = 2 R 2</strong>.</p>
		
			<h3>Practice Problems:</h3>
				<p>6 / 2 = <strong>?</strong></p>
				<p>12 / 3 = <strong>?</strong></p>
				<p>7 / 2 = <strong>?</strong></p>
				<p>15 / 1 = <strong>?</strong></p>
				<p>20 / 20 = <strong>?</strong></p>
			
			<h3>Answers:</h3>
				<p>6 / 2 = <strong>3</strong></p>
				<p>12 / 3 = <strong>4</strong></p>
				<p>7 / 2 = <strong>3 R 1</strong></p>
				<p>15 / 1 = <strong>15</strong></p>
				<p>20 / 20 = <strong>1</strong></p>
